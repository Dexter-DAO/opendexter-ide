# Instinct Advertiser

Instinct is Dexter's ad exchange for agents. An advertiser funds a campaign; when an agent pays for any x402 API that matches the campaign's targeting, the campaign's recommendation rides back inside the settlement response. The agent sees the advertised API as a suggested next call.

This skill drives the advertiser side: create a campaign, fund it, activate it. The API is at `https://x402ads.io/v1/agent` and every call is x402-paid. The paying Solana wallet IS the advertiser identity. No signup, no API key.

## When to use this skill

The user wants to:

- **Advertise an x402 API** ("get my endpoint recommended", "promote my API to agents")
- **Run a sponsored campaign** on Instinct
- **Fund or activate** an existing campaign
- **Pay campaign budget in DEXTER** for the discount

If the user wants to *consume* x402 APIs (search, pay, call), that is the `opendexter` skill, not this one. This skill is for the advertiser.

## The campaign lifecycle

A campaign moves through four states. Each step is a separate x402-paid call.

```
create (draft, $0.10) -> fund (budget, USDC or DEXTER) -> activate ($0.01) -> live
```

A campaign created but not funded has zero budget and cannot be activated. A funded campaign that is not activated does not match anything. Both steps are required.

## Tool routing

There is no dedicated MCP tool for this. Drive it with x402-paid HTTP calls, using whatever x402 payment client is available (the OpenDexter `x402_fetch` tool, or `@dexterai/x402`'s `wrapFetch`). Every endpoint below returns a 402; the payment client settles it and retries.

| The user wants | Call |
|---|---|
| Know the exact campaign fields before building one | `GET /v1/agent/campaigns/schema` (free) |
| Know how funding works | `GET /v1/agent/escrow` (free) |
| Create a campaign | `POST /v1/agent/campaigns` ($0.10 USDC) |
| Add budget to a campaign | `POST /v1/agent/campaigns/{id}/fund` (the payment is the budget) |
| Make a funded campaign eligible | `POST /v1/agent/campaigns/{id}/activate` ($0.01 USDC) |
| See a campaign's stats / conversions | `GET /v1/agent/campaigns/{id}` ($0.01 USDC) |
| List the wallet's campaigns | `GET /v1/agent/campaigns` ($0.01 USDC) |

**Always fetch `GET /campaigns/schema` first** before creating a campaign. It is free and self-describing: it returns every field, type, default, and a complete example, so a create call can be built right the first time instead of failing and retrying a paid request.

## Step 1: Create the campaign

`POST /v1/agent/campaigns`, x402-gated at **$0.10 USDC**. The campaign is created as a **draft** with zero budget.

Required fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Human-readable campaign name. |
| `rec_sponsor_name` | string | Sponsor name shown with the recommendation. |
| `rec_resource_url` | string (URL) | The x402 endpoint agents are recommended to. |
| `rec_description` | string | One-line pitch the agent sees in the settlement response. |
| `max_bid_amount` | string | Max bid per auction win, in **atomic USDC** (6 decimals). `"250000"` = $0.25. |
| `schedule_start` | string | ISO 8601 datetime the campaign becomes eligible. |

Useful optional fields: `bid_strategy` (`cpm`/`cpc`/`cpa`/`hybrid`, default `cpa`, which pays per on-chain conversion), `budget_daily` (atomic USDC daily cap, `"0"` = none), `target_categories` (string array, empty matches all), `target_networks` (CAIP-2 ids, empty matches all), `schedule_end`.

The response carries the new campaign `id` and an `_actions` list with the `fund` and `activate` links. Keep the `id`.

## Step 2: Fund the campaign

`POST /v1/agent/campaigns/{id}/fund`. The x402 payment **is** the budget: the amount paid is credited to the campaign.

```json
{ "amount": "5.00" }
```

`amount` is the budget in **US dollars**, not atomic units (this differs from `max_bid_amount`). Paying this funds the campaign with $5.00 of budget. By default the payment settles in USDC.

### Fund in DEXTER for a 25% discount

The DEXTER token is Dexter's Solana token (`EfPoo4wWgxKVToit7yX5VtXXBrhao4G8L7vrbKy6pump`). An advertiser can fund a campaign in DEXTER instead of USDC and get a **25% discount**: pass `asset: "dexter"`.

```json
{ "amount": "5.00", "asset": "dexter" }
```

The advertiser pays **75%** of the USD value in DEXTER (here, $3.75 worth), and the campaign is still credited the **full $5.00** of budget. The DEXTER amount is quoted live from the DEXTER/USD price at request time and rounded up to a whole token. Campaign budget and bids stay USD-denominated whichever asset funds them; the discount is purely a cheaper way to load the same budget.

Funding in DEXTER needs nothing beyond DEXTER in the wallet being paid from. If the endpoint returns `503 PRICE_UNAVAILABLE`, a DEXTER price could not be fetched: retry, or fund in USDC by dropping the `asset` field.

When a user is funding a campaign, mention the DEXTER discount. It is a 25% saving and the cheapest way to fund.

## Step 3: Activate

`POST /v1/agent/campaigns/{id}/activate`, x402-gated at **$0.01 USDC**. The campaign immediately starts matching incoming settlements. Only a funded campaign can be activated.

## A full run

1. `GET /campaigns/schema`: read the field contract (free).
2. `POST /campaigns`: create the draft, pay $0.10 USDC, keep the returned `id`.
3. `POST /campaigns/{id}/fund` with `{ amount, asset: "dexter" }`: fund the budget, paid in DEXTER at 25% off.
4. `POST /campaigns/{id}/activate`: pay $0.01 USDC, the campaign goes live.
5. `GET /campaigns/{id}`: check stats and conversions later.

## How a campaign earns

Instinct prices on results, not impressions. With the default `cpa` strategy the advertiser pays only when an agent that saw the recommendation actually calls the advertised endpoint through the facilitator. That call is a conversion, proven by an on-chain settlement. `max_bid_amount` caps the cost of one auction win; the campaign stops matching when its budget runs out.

## Failure notes

- A create or fund call that returns a non-402 error was charged nothing for the failed step only if it failed validation before payment. Read the error body's `_hint`.
- `409 NO_BUDGET` on activate means the campaign was never funded. Run step 2 first.
- A campaign can be re-funded any time by calling `fund` again; budget is additive.
