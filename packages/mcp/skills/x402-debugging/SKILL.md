# x402 Debugging Guide

## Quick Diagnosis Checklist

1. **Is the facilitator healthy?** `curl https://x402.dexter.cash/healthz`
2. **Does it support the network?** `curl https://x402.dexter.cash/supported`
3. **Does the wallet have funds?** Check USDC balance (the facilitator pays tx fees on all chains)
4. **Is the network format correct?** v2 uses CAIP-2 (`solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp`), not `"solana"`
5. **Is the client handling 402?** Must use `wrapFetch`, `createX402Client`, or manual PAYMENT-SIGNATURE flow
6. **Is the right scheme used?** All chains support `exact`. Some EVM chains also support `upto`. Check `/supported` for the full list.

## Common Issues and Fixes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| 402 but no payment prompt | Client not handling 402 responses | Use `wrapFetch()` or `createX402Client()` from `@dexterai/x402/client` |
| Payment verification fails | Wrong network format | Use CAIP-2 for v2: `solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp` |
| "Insufficient balance" | Wallet lacks USDC | Fund wallet, check with `x402_wallet` |
| Settlement timeout | Solana RPC congestion | Increase `maxTimeoutSeconds`, check RPC health, or use `maxRetries` |
| "Missing fee payer" | Solana accept missing `extra.feePayer` | Facilitator must provide `feePayer` in the accept |
| "No matching payment option" | No wallet for available chains | Add wallet for the required chain (Solana or EVM) |
| Backpressure rejection | Too many concurrent settlements | Wait and retry, or reduce concurrent requests |
| "Amount exceeds max" | `maxAmountAtomic` safety limit hit | Increase the limit or use a cheaper endpoint |
| Payment rejected after signing | Server rejected the signed tx | Check `errorReason` in the 402 response body |
| Access pass expired | JWT token past `exp` claim | Client auto-renews with `autoRenew: true` |
| "Unsupported network" | SDK doesn't have an adapter for this chain | Add the appropriate wallet (Solana or EVM) |
| "User rejected signature" | User declined wallet signing prompt | Prompt user to try again, don't auto-retry |
| "Transaction build failed" | Failed to construct the payment tx | Check wallet connection, RPC health, token accounts |
| BSC payment fails | BSC USDC may lack Permit2 approval | Check facilitator `/supported` for BSC-specific requirements |

## Facilitator Endpoints

```bash
# Health check
curl https://x402.dexter.cash/healthz

# Supported networks and schemes
curl https://x402.dexter.cash/supported
# Returns: { kinds: [...], extensions: [...], signers: { ... } }
# kinds include: exact (all chains), upto (Base/Polygon/Arbitrum), bridge (Solana/Base)

# Manual verification
curl -X POST https://x402.dexter.cash/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"paymentPayload": {...}, "paymentRequirements": {...}}'

# Manual settlement
curl -X POST https://x402.dexter.cash/settle \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"paymentPayload": {...}, "paymentRequirements": {...}}'
```

### SDK Error Codes (X402Error)

These are thrown by the client SDK (`@dexterai/x402/client`):

| Code | Context | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `missing_payment_required_header` | Client | Server sent 402 without PAYMENT-REQUIRED header |
| `invalid_payment_required` | Client | Could not decode PAYMENT-REQUIRED header |

| `access_pass_exceeds_max_spend` | Access | Tier price exceeds client's maxSpend |

## Debugging wrapFetch

Enable verbose logging to see the full payment flow:

```typescript
const x402Fetch = wrapFetch(fetch, {
  walletPrivateKey: process.env.SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY!,
  verbose: true, // Logs: request → 402 → balance check → sign → retry → result
});
```

### Pre-payment callback

Use `onPaymentRequired` to inspect or reject payments before signing:

```typescript
const x402Fetch = wrapFetch(fetch, {
  walletPrivateKey: process.env.SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY!,
  onPaymentRequired: (requirements) => {
    const amount = Number(requirements.amount) / 1e6;
    console.log(`About to pay $${amount} on ${requirements.network}`);
    return amount <= 1.0; // Reject payments over $1
  },
});
```

### Retry support

For transient failures (network errors, 502/503), use retry:

```typescript
const client = createX402Client({
  wallets,
  maxRetries: 2,      // 2 retries after initial attempt
  retryDelayMs: 500,  // 500ms, 1000ms between retries
  verbose: true,
});
```

Retries are safe — EIP-3009 nonces and Solana blockhash expiry prevent double payments.

## Fee Payer Safety (Solana)

The facilitator's fee payer must NOT:
- Appear in any instruction's `accounts` array
- Be the transfer `authority` or `source`
- Be used for anything except paying transaction fees

If you see `invalid_exact_svm_payload_fee_payer_exposed`, the transaction incorrectly includes the fee payer in an instruction.
