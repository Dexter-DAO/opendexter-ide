# Authentication and wallet state

Keep three states separate:

1. **Connector OAuth**: whether this client may invoke protected OpenDexter
   tools.
2. **MCP session binding**: whether the authenticated MCP session is durably
   linked to a stored Dexter Wallet identity.
3. **Wallet enrollment and readiness**: whether the user has completed their
   passkey ceremony and the wallet can perform the requested operation.

Success in one state does not prove either of the others. In particular, OAuth
success does not mean the wallet is enrolled, bound, funded, active, or ready.

## OAuth identity

- MCP resource and audience: `https://open.dexter.cash/mcp`
- Protected-resource metadata:
  `https://open.dexter.cash/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`
- Authorization-server issuer: `https://mcp.dexter.cash/mcp`
- Authorization-server metadata:
  `https://mcp.dexter.cash/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/mcp`
- Access-token issuer: `https://dexter.cash`
- Protected scope: `vault`

The authorization-server issuer and access-token issuer are deliberately
different identities. Do not rewrite either one.

OAuth is required before MCP initialization and tool discovery. Each hosted
tool advertises canonical `securitySchemes` and the
back-compatibility `_meta.securitySchemes` mirror. An unauthenticated
initialization is refused at the transport layer with HTTP 401,
`Cache-Control: no-store`, and a Bearer challenge containing
`resource_metadata` and `scope`.

That initial HTTP 401 happens before a tool session or tool list exists. Let
the host surface its native OpenDexter Connect action and complete OAuth before
reloading discovery. An established connection whose authorization has become
stale can instead return `authentication_required` from a protected tool; let
the host resume OAuth and retry that same tool once. Do not describe the
initial transport challenge as a tool-level `authentication_required` result.

## Native client action

Use the client action already surfaced for the configured MCP:

- ChatGPT or Codex Desktop: **Connect**.
- Codex CLI: `codex mcp login opendexter`.
- Claude Code: `/mcp` or `claude mcp login opendexter`.

Use a returned hosted approval or enrollment URL only for its stated wallet
action and retain the original task for continuation. Never relay a
personalized MCP URL, bearer token or one-time credential, or substitute an
approval URL for the configured connector.

After initial native OAuth, reload tool discovery once. After resuming OAuth on
an established connection, retry the same blocked tool once. If either still
challenges, stop and report connector OAuth as the failed layer. Do not switch
to enrollment or create a second connector.

For a valid OAuth session whose wallet is not ready, use `dexter_wallet` and the
hosted wallet UI. The user completes the passkey ceremony on Dexter's secure
surface; the model never handles passkey material.
